To preserve this unique experience for everyone, it's vital to practice the Leave No Trace principle of \"Respect Wildlife.\"","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./respect-wildlife.jpg","Two mule deer bucks standing in a field of grass","## Respecting Wildlife at Ute Valley Park\r\n\r\nUte Valley Park is a beautiful natural area that many of us enjoy visiting for recreation and relaxation. However, it's important to remember that we share this space with a diverse array of wildlife. As park visitors, we have a responsibility to respect these animals and their habitat.\r\n\r\nWhen we visit the park, we are guests in the home of countless wild animals. Respecting their space and habits is not just courteous—it's crucial for their survival and the health of the ecosystem.\r\n\r\n### What does it mean to Respect Wildlife?\r\n\r\nRespecting Wildlife involves:\r\n\r\n- Observing animals from a distance to avoid distressing them.\r\n- Refraining from feeding wildlife, which can lead to unhealthy dependency and risk of disease.\r\n- Keeping pets on a leash and under control to prevent them from chasing or harassing wildlife.\r\n- Avoiding wildlife during sensitive times, such as mating, nesting, or when they have young with them.\r\n\r\n### Why is it important to Respect Wildlife?\r\n\r\nThis principle is important because it:\r\n\r\n- Protects animal welfare and preserves natural behaviors.\r\n- Maintains ecological balance and ensures species can thrive in their natural habitat. Wildlife plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy ecosystems through complex relationships like predator-prey dynamics, seed dispersal, and nutrient cycling.\r\n- Enhances visitor safety, as wildlife is unpredictable and can be dangerous when threatened.\r\n- Ensures that future visitors can also enjoy watching wildlife in its natural state.\r\n\r\n### How can visitors practice Respecting Wildlife?\r\n\r\nVisitors can show respect for wildlife by:\r\n\r\n- **Using binoculars or a zoom lens for a closer look.**\r\n  \r\n  Get a close-up view without getting too close physically. This minimizes stress for animals, allows you to observe their natural behavior, and enhances your experience by revealing details you might otherwise miss.\r\n\r\n- **Being mindful of noise levels.**\r\n  \r\n  Loud noises can frighten wildlife and disrupt their communication, mating rituals, and hunting behaviors, which can have far-reaching ecological consequences. Speak softly and avoid loud activities that could disturb animals in their natural habitat.\r\n\r\n- **Storing food and trash securely.**\r\n  \r\n  Use bear-proof trash cans provided at park trailheads to dispose of garbage, and store your food appropriately while utilizing the park. This prevents wildlife from being attracted to human food, which can be harmful to their health and disrupt their natural foraging habits. Proper food storage also maintains the cleanliness and safety of the park for all visitors. Remember to always pack out and properly dispose of pet waste.\r\n\r\n- **Learning about the wildlife.**\r\n  \r\n  Before you visit, take time to learn about the animals you might see in Ute Valley Park, such as mule deer, coyotes, rattlesnakes and black bears. Understanding their behavior and needs helps you make responsible decisions while in their presence.\r\n\r\n## Preserving the Sanctuary for All\r\n\r\nBy treating Ute Valley Park's wildlife with respect, we not only ensure the well-being of individual animals but also contribute to the long-term health of the entire ecosystem. As park visitors, we have the power to make a positive difference through our actions and choices. Let us embrace this responsibility and set a positive example for others, so that future generations may also have the opportunity to marvel at the beauty and diversity of the wildlife in this special place.\r\n\r\nBy following the Respect Wildlife principle, visitors can ensure that Ute Valley Park remains a sanctuary for both animals and people.

Always stay on designated trails, which are indicated by official park signage and well-maintained paths. These trails have been carefully designed to provide a safe and enjoyable experience while protecting the natural environment. Avoid cutting switchbacks or creating shortcuts, and always follow signs to ensure you remain on approved routes.\r\n\r\n### Choose the right trail.\r\n  \r\nUte Valley Park offers trails suitable for various users, including hikers, bikers, and equestrians. Choose a trail that aligns with your activity and skill level, and adhere to the signs and rules specific to each trail. By doing so, you'll help reduce conflicts and accidents among users while minimizing excessive wear and tear on the trails.\r\n\r\n### Walk through mud and snow.\r\n  \r\nWhen trails are wet or snowy, walk through the center of the trail, even if it's muddy. This practice helps keep the trail narrow and prevents widening and braiding. Avoid walking around puddles or snow patches, as this can damage vegetation and lead to the creation of new trails. If the trails are excessively muddy or snowy, consider postponing your visit or opting for another trail.\r\n\r\n### Camp elsewhere.\r\n  \r\nUte Valley Park does not allow camping within its boundaries. Camping is illegal and can lead to fire hazards, littering, and wildlife conflicts. If you wish to camp, please find a legal and suitable campsite outside the park.\r\n\r\n## Embrace Responsible Outdoor Ethics\r\n\r\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can fully immerse yourself in the beauty of Ute Valley Park while simultaneously respecting and protecting its natural environment. Remember, the essence of being outdoors lies in moving through natural areas without causing damage to the land, foliage, or waterways. Strive to leave no trace of your visit, and, if possible, leave the place even better than you found it.\r\n\r\nSo, the next time you visit Ute Valley Park, keep these tips in mind.

She asked him if he liked living here and he replied, “Yes, I do. The people are good, friendly and helpful.” Not sure if I physically nodded my head upon hearing that response but certainly did so mentally being in full agreement. He said he came here from Atlanta, and the South has always been offered up for their hospitality, so that statement about Colorado Springs carries some weight.\n\nThe reply noted above is certainly an accurate description of a couple of people who have recently passed through my purview. First up is John N. Ordahl. I recently met with John to learn his family’s long history with our neighborhood, and to see a historic sign (pictured here) he has that came off a fence adjacent to his home here in Pinecliff. His father, John A. Ordahl and some of his friends purchased a tract of land from an area rancher in the 1960s. John’s father built a home on some of that land in 1972, and John N. lived there into his college years. Building that home in 1972 was done before the creation of Ute Valley Park in 1976, that involved the City of Colorado Springs, developer Dave Sellon, and the Golden Cycle Land Corp. It was before the concentrated development of the Pinecliff neighborhood.\n\nJohn N. returned to live in Pinecliff, acquiring land from his father, and built his home on that land in 2001. The property is in the very southwest sector of Pinecliff and butts up against Ute Valley Park. In addition to the sign, he retained some pieces of barbed wire and has also discovered a unique fence post and barbed wire support piece that date back to the early 1900s.\n\nThe Licensed Preserve was held under the Glen Eyrie Development Co. A quick look into that company did not yield a result but further research and results will be shared here. John has plans to donate this historical sign to the Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum, a donation which is very timely as our city celebrates its 150th birthday. Many thanks to him for his outreach with this peek into our Pinecliff and Ute Valley Park past.\n\nAnother person I wanted to lift up here is area Realtor Alicia Moskal. Alicia moved to Pinecliff in 1995. Recently, through a marketing piece she invested in for distribution to our neighborhood, she made it a point to promote Ute Valley Park. She shared the experiences she and her family have enjoyed in UVP and encouraged others to volunteer their time to help in maintaining the park or to make a monetary donation to help as well. I have never met Alicia but am appreciative for her investing her monies to provide an important message about our neighborhood and our beloved park.\n\nColorado Springs does have a lot of good, friendly and helpful people and encountering them always makes me want to do more to achieve that status as well.

Much of the change we can control, but there is a lot we cannot.\n\nSome change we initiate, some we are good to accept, and some we really resist. Change is inevitable, time for a change, and change is good are all expressions we commonly hear on the subject. We recently changed seasons from winter to spring, although with our winter weather of late it is often difficult to discern there was a change.\n\nSome good changes have happened recently on The Friends of Ute Valley Park website ([www.friendsofutevalleypark.com](https://www.friendsofutevalleypark.com/)). We invite you to come visit the site to see our fresh new look that provides current news, park use rules, volunteering opportunities, and other key details. On the site we have also included the Leave No Trace 7 principles to encourage all of us to do our very best when enjoying other parks.\n\nWarmer, drier weather will eventually arrive, and along with it the Friends of Ute Valley Park are beginning our Volunteer Evening Work Sessions. They get underway on Wednesday, April 7. Those sessions take place, weather permitting, the first and third Wednesday of the month, from April through September. Last year we were challenged by the effects of COVID in not allowing us the number of volunteers that were willing to turn out. This year, with good guidance from the [Colorado Springs Park, Recreation and Cultural Services](https://coloradosprings.gov/parks), one change has been made. If the volunteer group grows larger, then multiple groups can be created, which will allow for work to be done on different projects in separate areas to provide the necessary social distancing.\n\nRegistration is done via the CERVIS site. To sign-up and learn all the details go to [www.friendsofutevalleypark.com](http://www.friendsofutevalleypark.com).\n\nListed below are some of the tentatively scheduled work projects for this year:\n\n- Reroute winding woods south, where we put our drains in last year.\n- Closure of rogue trails going up to Rattlesnake Ridge. This would also close off the largest undisturbed natural area in Ute Valley Park.\n- Closure of rogue trails that originate off the new Regional Trail.\n- Another project for hopeful completion this year by an Eagle Scout is to close the Creek Trail. That is the last trail that traverses through the undisturbed 40-acre natural area created two summers ago.\n\nA significant change coming this year was the recent announcement by Colorado Springs Park, Recreation and Cultural Services to allow Class 1 electric pedal-assist bicycles city-wide on all trails that allow bicycles. This is a pilot program that will begin on May 31.\n\nDue to the pandemic, our area parks typically experienced a significant activity increase with people pursuing an escape and physical activity. It is unknown how to project the amount of additional trail traffic with this change. Medicine Wheel, a local mountain bike advocacy group, was generally in favor of e-bikes access to all trails coming along in a step-by-step process — but not in a blanket effort such as this.\n\nPedal-assist e-bikes generally max out at 20 mph, and a 15 mph speed limit has been set for ALL bikes on trails. That limit will be posted, although I do not think we will see speed traps set up anywhere, so enforcement fulfillment is unclear. The community input was pretty much a 50/50 split on support or non-support. With the numbers basically being equal, going forward 100% came as a surprise, and has certainly caused some fervor.\n\nAlso, City Ordinance 97-60 states the use of no motorized vehicles to be used on park trails, but e-bikes use an electric motor making them a motorized vehicle. So that means the current ordinance structure is an item that need to be addressed.\n\nLots of changes are happening and will continue to do so. Like our recent move to Daylight Saving Time by changing our clocks, some of these changes may take a while to get used to.","src/data/news/changes-afoot-at-ute-valley-park.md",[335],"/src/data/news/ute-news-6.jpg","a9d007faf51ebddc",{"html":338,"metadata":339},"\u003Cp>This article was originally published in the \u003Ca href=\"https://gazette.com/woodmenedition/changes-afoot-at-ute-valley-park-park-place/article_e83cfd98-8cd9-11eb-bcc7-a70e5944ca66.html\">Woodman Edition\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As we go through our life, we come to realize that change is and will always be a constant.

If the volunteer group grows larger, then multiple groups can be created, which will allow for work to be done on different projects in separate areas to provide the necessary social distancing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Registration is done via the CERVIS site. To sign-up and learn all the details go to \u003Ca href=\"http://www.friendsofutevalleypark.com\">www.friendsofutevalleypark.com\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Listed below are some of the tentatively scheduled work projects for this year:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Reroute winding woods south, where we put our drains in last year.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Closure of rogue trails going up to Rattlesnake Ridge. This would also close off the largest undisturbed natural area in Ute Valley Park.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Closure of rogue trails that originate off the new Regional Trail.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Another project for hopeful completion this year by an Eagle Scout is to close the Creek Trail. That is the last trail that traverses through the undisturbed 40-acre natural area created two summers ago.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>A significant change coming this year was the recent announcement by Colorado Springs Park, Recreation and Cultural Services to allow Class 1 electric pedal-assist bicycles city-wide on all trails that allow bicycles. This is a pilot program that will begin on May 31.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Due to the pandemic, our area parks typically experienced a significant activity increase with people pursuing an escape and physical activity. It is unknown how to project the amount of additional trail traffic with this change. Medicine Wheel, a local mountain bike advocacy group, was generally in favor of e-bikes access to all trails coming along in a step-by-step process — but not in a blanket effort such as this.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pedal-assist e-bikes generally max out at 20 mph, and a 15 mph speed limit has been set for ALL bikes on trails. That limit will be posted, although I do not think we will see speed traps set up anywhere, so enforcement fulfillment is unclear. The community input was pretty much a 50/50 split on support or non-support. With the numbers basically being equal, going forward 100% came as a surprise, and has certainly caused some fervor.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Also, City Ordinance 97-60 states the use of no motorized vehicles to be used on park trails, but e-bikes use an electric motor making them a motorized vehicle. So that means the current ordinance structure is an item that need to be addressed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lots of changes are happening and will continue to do so. Like our recent move to Daylight Saving Time by changing our clocks, some of these changes may take a while to get used to.\u003C/p>",{"headings":340,"localImagePaths":341,"remoteImagePaths":342,"frontmatter":343,"imagePaths":345},[],[],[],{"title":328,"published":133,"publishedOn":344,"coverImage":335,"previewText":331},["Date","2021-03-30T13:29:26.321Z"],[],"friends-of-ute-valley-park-year-end-review",{"id":346,"data":348,"body":353,"filePath":354,"assetImports":355,"digest":357,"rendered":358},{"title":349,"published":133,"publishedOn":350,"coverImage":351,"previewText":352},"Friends of Ute Valley Park Year End Review",["Date","2023-12-14T15:36:01.366Z"],"__ASTRO_IMAGE_/src/data/news/ute-news-12-14-23.jpg","As 2023 winds down it is typical to review our accomplishments during the year as well as noting those items that may still be on a To Do List.","As 2023 winds down it is typical to review our accomplishments during the year as well as noting those items that may still be on a To Do List.

We have a few important updates and events to share with you.\n\nFirst, mark your calendars for our upcoming volunteer day on April 3rd from 5:30-7:30PM. We'll be focusing our efforts on drainage and tread work on the Winding Woods Loop trail, as well as removing invasive Mullein plants along the regional trail. Your help is crucial in maintaining the beauty and accessibility of our park. Please join us if you can! \n\nSign up [here](https://cerv.is/0132x4184) for the April 3rd event!\n\nNext, we want to take a moment to congratulate and thank our former ranger, Mark Tatro, for his years of dedicated service to Ute Valley Park. Mark has recently moved on to \"redder pastures\" and is now the senior park ranger for Garden of the Gods. While we will miss him greatly, we are thrilled for this exciting new chapter in his career. Thank you, Mark, for all you've done for our park!\n\nWith Mark's departure, the city is actively seeking to fill the park ranger position. Additionally, we need your help in identifying areas of the park that require extra attention. If you notice any troubled spots during your visits, please let us know so we can focus our volunteer efforts effectively.\n\nLastly, we're excited to announce several upcoming fundraising events in collaboration with local breweries. These \"pint nights\" are a fantastic opportunity to enjoy great beer while supporting our park. A portion of the proceeds from each event will directly benefit Friends of Ute Valley Park. Here are the details to mark your calendars (and we'll send reminders closer to the dates):\n\n* Cerberus at [Seven's Gate Tap Room](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B91xhWHEQrN3oDZp9) April 9th 4-7PM\n* [B﻿rass Brewing](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sDssNPn4tA9NnK1fA) April 17th 5-7PM\n* [W﻿ackadoo Brewing](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nH6eiqeStqgzvdbFA) May 11th 5-7PM\n* [O﻿CC Brewing](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J5QY6TCwBgumGcoM6) June 14th 6-8PM\n\nWe hope you'll join us for these fun evenings and help spread the word to your friends and family.\n\nThank you, as always, for your unwavering support and love for Ute Valley Park.

Larry Kitt, the park ranger, tells the group: \"It’s going to be an easy start for this trail-work year. I’m going to leave it to your crew leaders to give you a safety briefing, but I want to make sure that the top three things are done: safety, safety, fun!\"\n\nTrail leader Nick Cirincione, after dividing the volunteers into two groups, gives a quick safety talk. He ends by saying, \"When you’re walking with the tools, they’re not over your shoulders like ‘Hi ho, it’s off to work we go,’ but you carry them in your hand below your waist. OK? Now let’s get to work.\"\nThe group heads up the new trail, cutting vegetation, clearing brush, creating water bars, moving boulders and tamping down loose soil. A line of orange flags, placed by the ranger, marks the line of the trail, which makes a broad switchback up the hogback’s east slope before joining an existing social trail on the ridge crest.\n\n\"The trail we’re working on right now,\" says Dan Woods, president of Friends of Ute Valley Park, \"goes along the top of the hogback before dropping down and joining Pine Ridge Trail. We started this trail last year and will get it done this spring.\"\n\nWoods says the new trail, called West Ridge Trail, climbs gentle slopes onto the ridge, then heads north, with spacious views west toward Pikes Peak and east toward Austin Bluffs.\n\nUte Valley Park, a 540-acre city parkland, spreads east of the rocky hogback beneath the mountains on the northwest edge of Colorado Springs. The park, popular with hikers, mountain bikers and climbers, protects a foothills ecosystem of ponderosa pine and scrub oak woodlands, broad meadows and broken rock outcrops. The park’s most dramatic feature is Pope’s Bluffs, a long ridge formed of Dakota sandstone.\n\n\"It looks like we have a big group today,\" said Woods earlier, looking across the parking lot on Vindicator Drive. \"We usually have 10 to 15 volunteers, people of all ages, who show up to work on trail days.\" The Friends group organizes trail days from April through October on the first and third Wednesdays of each month. \"It’s not a huge investment of time for people,\" said Woods, \"since we work from 5:30 to about 7:30 in the evening.\"\n\nFriends of Ute Valley Park was founded in late 2012 to help facilitate the city of Colorado Springs’ purchase of 203 acres of property owned by Hewlett Packard east of the park. The city coveted the land, along with developers who had platted it for 169 homes and five commercial sites. Woods said, \"Our homeowner’s association over in Pinecliff where I live heard about the possible sale. Our president went to the parks department and asked, ‘How can we help with the purchase of the property?’\"\n\nThe Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Services Department told the association \"that it would be really nice if there was a Friends group who would take on the task of maintaining trails and making new trails in the existing park so that we could show that there was already some community ownership in the park.\"\n\n\"Quite frankly,\" said Woods, \"if we hadn’t been in existence, it would have been a lot tougher to get the deal made. The $110,000 we raised was a piddly amount compared to the 7.5 million that was paid for the property, but it showed we had some skin in the game. People were pretty passionate about getting it into the park rather than have it developed.\" The final transfer of the HP property to Ute Valley Park was in 2015, with the new acres managed as open space by the Palmer Land Trust. A master plan was also approved, outlining new trails in the open space and the rest of the park, creating trailheads at Tech Center Drive and off the HP road, and closing social trails. Friends of Ute Valley Park played a key role in implementing these management goals.\n\nThis year, the Friends group and its volunteers will complete the West Ridge Trail and then finish work on the East Loop Trail, which crosses the new acreage, ending at the Tech Center Drive trailhead. This work began in September with the aid of a $20,000 grant from REI, which allowed the city to hire contract trail builders to use heavy equipment on difficult terrain.\n\nThe group also plans to rehabilitate trails damaged by flooding. The Friends hosted only eight trail days last year, due to rainy weather, while the City allocated FEMA dollars to hire private contractors to repair damaged trails.\n\nLast year, Woods said Friends of Ute Valley Park had 60 volunteers put in 185 hours on the bimonthly trail days and another 170 volunteers, including 75 Air Force cadets, on National Trails Day and National Public Lands Day.\n\nAfter working for two hours, the sun drops behind the Rampart Range.

Vance's commitment deepened quickly. \"The following spring I was certified by the Rocky Mountain Field Institute (RMFI) as a Crew Leader and have rarely missed a work night since.\"\r\n\r\n## A Spiritual Connection to Nature\r\n\r\nFor Vance, running in Ute Valley Park is more than just exercise—it's a spiritual experience. \"When I'm running I'm praying,\" he reveals, \"and not just to assure this old fella doesn't fall but mostly an extreme thankfulness for this array of hues, sounds and feelings this unbelievable creation has on my senses.\" This deep appreciation for nature fuels his dedication to preserving and improving the park.\r\n\r\n## Favorite Spots and Activities\r\n\r\nAs an avid runner, Vance has a special affinity for the West Ridge of Ute Valley Park. \"I have run the West Ridge of Ute Valley Park 3-5 times a week since 1987,\" he says. \"It absolutely has the best 360 degree views of all the parks in El Paso County and a surreal feeling this was a strategic trail of the Núu-agha-tʉvʉ-pʉ̱ (Ute).\" His connection to this trail spans decades, making his volunteer work all the more meaningful.\r\n\r\n## Understanding the Park's Importance\r\n\r\nVance's involvement in various activities at the park has given him a broad perspective on its importance to different user groups. \"I race in several of the races in the park and am grateful for all the work that we volunteers do to assure trails remain sustainable to protect the wildlife and vegetation,\" he explains. \"Trail maintenance assures the greatest number of individuals can enjoy the park whether they are walkers, bikers or runners. Oh throw in the occasional horse riders.\"\r\n\r\n## Inspiring Others to Volunteer\r\n\r\nWhen asked how to inspire more people to volunteer, Vance had a creative suggestion: \"UVP needs a mascot. Then use the mascot in a poster with its finger pointing out saying 'UVP needs you'. Yes, it's similar to the WWII Uncle Sam Poster.\"\r\n\r\n## Advice for Potential Volunteers\r\n\r\nFor those considering volunteering, Vance emphasizes the sense of accomplishment it brings: \"If you want a real sense of achievement and contribution to the community, you will get it when you look back over your work in restoring a trail to a sustainable path that many will use in their enjoyment of nature up close.\" His words highlight the tangible impact volunteers can have on their community and environment.\r\n\r\nVance Hewuse's story is one of long-term commitment, passion, and the profound impact one person can have on their community.
