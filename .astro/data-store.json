From hiking and biking to wildlife watching, this park has something for everyone. However, we must remember that this fragile ecosystem demands our utmost care and respect.","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./travel-on-durable-surfaces.jpeg","Wayfinding sign next to a trail","Our goal when visiting Ute Valley Park should be to leave it in the same condition as we found it, if not better. Unfortunately, our footsteps and activities can sometimes cause harm to the land, flora, and fauna. That's where traveling on durable surfaces comes in - these surfaces can withstand or recover from the impact of our visit.\r\n\r\n## What exactly are durable surfaces?\r\n\r\nDurable surfaces are those that can handle repeated trampling and scuffing without compromising their structure or function. In Ute Valley Park, you'll find several types of durable surfaces:\r\n\r\n- Well-established trails\r\n- Rock, gravel and sand\r\n- Snow and ice\r\n- Water\r\n\r\n## The importance of traveling on durable surfaces\r\n\r\nBy sticking to durable surfaces, you're actively contributing to:\r\n\r\n- Preventing soil erosion and compaction\r\n- Safeguarding vegetation and animal habitats\r\n- Curbing the spread of invasive species and diseases\r\n- Preserving the park's natural beauty and diversity\r\n- Avoiding the creation of new trails that can fragment the wilderness\r\n- Minimizing the need for trail maintenance and restoration\r\n\r\n## Strategies for traveling on durable surfaces in Ute Valley Park\r\n\r\n### Stay on trail.\r\n  \r\nVenturing off-trail is strictly prohibited in Ute Valley Park. Always stay on designated trails, which are indicated by official park signage and well-maintained paths. These trails have been carefully designed to provide a safe and enjoyable experience while protecting the natural environment. Avoid cutting switchbacks or creating shortcuts, and always follow signs to ensure you remain on approved routes.\r\n\r\n### Choose the right trail.\r\n  \r\nUte Valley Park offers trails suitable for various users, including hikers, bikers, and equestrians. Choose a trail that aligns with your activity and skill level, and adhere to the signs and rules specific to each trail. By doing so, you'll help reduce conflicts and accidents among users while minimizing excessive wear and tear on the trails.\r\n\r\n### Walk through mud and snow.\r\n  \r\nWhen trails are wet or snowy, walk through the center of the trail, even if it's muddy. This practice helps keep the trail narrow and prevents widening and braiding. Avoid walking around puddles or snow patches, as this can damage vegetation and lead to the creation of new trails. If the trails are excessively muddy or snowy, consider postponing your visit or opting for another trail.\r\n\r\n### Camp elsewhere.\r\n  \r\nUte Valley Park does not allow camping within its boundaries. Camping is illegal and can lead to fire hazards, littering, and wildlife conflicts. If you wish to camp, please find a legal and suitable campsite outside the park.\r\n\r\n## Embrace Responsible Outdoor Ethics\r\n\r\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can fully immerse yourself in the beauty of Ute Valley Park while simultaneously respecting and protecting its natural environment. Remember, the essence of being outdoors lies in moving through natural areas without causing damage to the land, foliage, or waterways. Strive to leave no trace of your visit, and, if possible, leave the place even better than you found it.\r\n\r\nSo, the next time you visit Ute Valley Park, keep these tips in mind. By being a responsible park visitor, you're not only ensuring a memorable experience for yourself but also preserving the park's pristine beauty for generations to come.

To preserve this unique experience for everyone, it's vital to practice the Leave No Trace principle of \"Respect Wildlife.\"","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./respect-wildlife.jpg","Two mule deer bucks standing in a field of grass","## Respecting Wildlife at Ute Valley Park\r\n\r\nUte Valley Park is a beautiful natural area that many of us enjoy visiting for recreation and relaxation. However, it's important to remember that we share this space with a diverse array of wildlife. As park visitors, we have a responsibility to respect these animals and their habitat.\r\n\r\nWhen we visit the park, we are guests in the home of countless wild animals. Respecting their space and habits is not just courteous—it's crucial for their survival and the health of the ecosystem.\r\n\r\n### What does it mean to Respect Wildlife?\r\n\r\nRespecting Wildlife involves:\r\n\r\n- Observing animals from a distance to avoid distressing them.\r\n- Refraining from feeding wildlife, which can lead to unhealthy dependency and risk of disease.\r\n- Keeping pets on a leash and under control to prevent them from chasing or harassing wildlife.\r\n- Avoiding wildlife during sensitive times, such as mating, nesting, or when they have young with them.\r\n\r\n### Why is it important to Respect Wildlife?\r\n\r\nThis principle is important because it:\r\n\r\n- Protects animal welfare and preserves natural behaviors.\r\n- Maintains ecological balance and ensures species can thrive in their natural habitat. Wildlife plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy ecosystems through complex relationships like predator-prey dynamics, seed dispersal, and nutrient cycling.\r\n- Enhances visitor safety, as wildlife is unpredictable and can be dangerous when threatened.\r\n- Ensures that future visitors can also enjoy watching wildlife in its natural state.\r\n\r\n### How can visitors practice Respecting Wildlife?\r\n\r\nVisitors can show respect for wildlife by:\r\n\r\n- **Using binoculars or a zoom lens for a closer look.**\r\n  \r\n  Get a close-up view without getting too close physically. This minimizes stress for animals, allows you to observe their natural behavior, and enhances your experience by revealing details you might otherwise miss.\r\n\r\n- **Being mindful of noise levels.**\r\n  \r\n  Loud noises can frighten wildlife and disrupt their communication, mating rituals, and hunting behaviors, which can have far-reaching ecological consequences. Speak softly and avoid loud activities that could disturb animals in their natural habitat.\r\n\r\n- **Storing food and trash securely.**\r\n  \r\n  Use bear-proof trash cans provided at park trailheads to dispose of garbage, and store your food appropriately while utilizing the park. This prevents wildlife from being attracted to human food, which can be harmful to their health and disrupt their natural foraging habits. Proper food storage also maintains the cleanliness and safety of the park for all visitors. Remember to always pack out and properly dispose of pet waste.\r\n\r\n- **Learning about the wildlife.**\r\n  \r\n  Before you visit, take time to learn about the animals you might see in Ute Valley Park, such as mule deer, coyotes, rattlesnakes and black bears. Understanding their behavior and needs helps you make responsible decisions while in their presence.\r\n\r\n## Preserving the Sanctuary for All\r\n\r\nBy treating Ute Valley Park's wildlife with respect, we not only ensure the well-being of individual animals but also contribute to the long-term health of the entire ecosystem. As park visitors, we have the power to make a positive difference through our actions and choices. Let us embrace this responsibility and set a positive example for others, so that future generations may also have the opportunity to marvel at the beauty and diversity of the wildlife in this special place.\r\n\r\nBy following the Respect Wildlife principle, visitors can ensure that Ute Valley Park remains a sanctuary for both animals and people.

She asked him if he liked living here and he replied, “Yes, I do. The people are good, friendly and helpful.” Not sure if I physically nodded my head upon hearing that response but certainly did so mentally being in full agreement. He said he came here from Atlanta, and the South has always been offered up for their hospitality, so that statement about Colorado Springs carries some weight.\n\nThe reply noted above is certainly an accurate description of a couple of people who have recently passed through my purview. First up is John N. Ordahl. I recently met with John to learn his family’s long history with our neighborhood, and to see a historic sign (pictured here) he has that came off a fence adjacent to his home here in Pinecliff. His father, John A. Ordahl and some of his friends purchased a tract of land from an area rancher in the 1960s. John’s father built a home on some of that land in 1972, and John N. lived there into his college years. Building that home in 1972 was done before the creation of Ute Valley Park in 1976, that involved the City of Colorado Springs, developer Dave Sellon, and the Golden Cycle Land Corp. It was before the concentrated development of the Pinecliff neighborhood.\n\nJohn N. returned to live in Pinecliff, acquiring land from his father, and built his home on that land in 2001. The property is in the very southwest sector of Pinecliff and butts up against Ute Valley Park. In addition to the sign, he retained some pieces of barbed wire and has also discovered a unique fence post and barbed wire support piece that date back to the early 1900s.\n\nThe Licensed Preserve was held under the Glen Eyrie Development Co. A quick look into that company did not yield a result but further research and results will be shared here. John has plans to donate this historical sign to the Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum, a donation which is very timely as our city celebrates its 150th birthday. Many thanks to him for his outreach with this peek into our Pinecliff and Ute Valley Park past.\n\nAnother person I wanted to lift up here is area Realtor Alicia Moskal. Alicia moved to Pinecliff in 1995. Recently, through a marketing piece she invested in for distribution to our neighborhood, she made it a point to promote Ute Valley Park. She shared the experiences she and her family have enjoyed in UVP and encouraged others to volunteer their time to help in maintaining the park or to make a monetary donation to help as well. I have never met Alicia but am appreciative for her investing her monies to provide an important message about our neighborhood and our beloved park.\n\nColorado Springs does have a lot of good, friendly and helpful people and encountering them always makes me want to do more to achieve that status as well.

Please respect these closures and utilize the new UVP Trail connectors that lead East and West from the trailhead.\u003C/p>",{"headings":1519,"localImagePaths":1520,"remoteImagePaths":1521,"frontmatter":1522,"imagePaths":1524},[],[],[],{"title":1507,"published":1420,"publishedOn":1523,"coverImage":1514,"previewText":1510},["Date","2022-01-19T19:37:12.359Z"],[],"changes-afoot-at-ute-valley-park",{"id":1525,"data":1527,"body":1532,"filePath":1533,"assetImports":1534,"digest":1536,"rendered":1537},{"title":1528,"published":1420,"publishedOn":1529,"coverImage":1530,"previewText":1531},"Changes afoot at Ute Valley Park",["Date","2021-03-30T13:29:26.321Z"],"__ASTRO_IMAGE_/src/data/news/ute-news-6.jpg","As we go through our life, we come to realize that change is and will always be a constant.

Not the nick­els, dimes and quar­ters rolling around in your car’s con­sole kind of change. Nope. This use of the word would be the embrace change kind of change.","This article originally appeared in the [North Springs Edition](https://daily.gazette.com/article/281565178917014)\n\nThe word of the day is change. Not the nick­els, dimes and quar­ters rolling around in your car’s con­sole kind of change. Nope. This use of the word would be the embrace change kind of change.\n\nSome people embrace change, many do not and would rather res­ist change. Change can be neg­at­ive, but pos­it­ive too. But here I will identify good change for you to know about, that you could help with, or may in fact already be involved in.\n\nThe volun­teer work ses­sions ini­ti­ated by the FUVP from April through Septem­ber have suc­cess­fully ended for this year. Now we change over to mon­it­or­ing the park through the fall and winter and will con­duct our plan­ning to determ­ine what improve­ments and changes will come about next year. Volun­teer sup­port stayed strong again this year and we will tally the res­ults and share them in this space soon. There will also be a recog­ni­tion event to thank the many volun­teers that stepped up to help with a vari­ety of projects.\n\nAnother change headed our way comes from the city. They have not reques­ted a fund­ing increase for Trails, Open Space and Parks for 24 years. That change will appear in the form of a min­is­cule increase asked of tax­pay­ers on the elec­tion bal­lot headed our way in early Octo­ber. The pop­u­la­tion growth in Col­or­ado Springs, and the over­whelm­ing pur­suit of out­door recre­ation dur­ing the pan­demic, has sig­ni­fic­antly increased the activ­ity in our parks and open spaces. Chances are good by your read­ing in this space you enjoy and appre­ci­ate Ute Val­ley Park and Open space. So, I encour­age you to look for your bal­lot and hope­fully show sup­port to this effort to allow Col­or­ado Springs to secure adequate open­space and con­tinue to provide well-main­tained parks and trails throughout the city.\n\nAnother change being reques­ted by the city is to allow $20 mil­lion from a TABOR reten­tion and be des­ig­nated from this year’s funds and go towards a city­wide fire mit­ig­a­tion project. With the local eco­nomy doing well the city occa­sion­ally col­lects more rev­en­ues than it was des­ig­nated for in a year. In that instance, it can be allowed to let the city keep those funds to ded­ic­ate to spe­cific projects.\n\nThe City of Col­or­ado Springs is in a pos­i­tion this year to ask voters to des­ig­nate this year’s funds to go toward city­wide fire mit­ig­a­tion projects. On the bal­lot this will be Issue 2D, and if approved by voters, it doubles the size of neigh­bor­hood chip­ping pro­grams to help keep our homes and neigh­bor­hoods safe.

Now we change over to mon­it­or­ing the park through the fall and winter and will con­duct our plan­ning to determ­ine what improve­ments and changes will come about next year. Volun­teer sup­port stayed strong again this year and we will tally the res­ults and share them in this space soon. There will also be a recog­ni­tion event to thank the many volun­teers that stepped up to help with a vari­ety of projects.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Another change headed our way comes from the city. They have not reques­ted a fund­ing increase for Trails, Open Space and Parks for 24 years. That change will appear in the form of a min­is­cule increase asked of tax­pay­ers on the elec­tion bal­lot headed our way in early Octo­ber. The pop­u­la­tion growth in Col­or­ado Springs, and the over­whelm­ing pur­suit of out­door recre­ation dur­ing the pan­demic, has sig­ni­fic­antly increased the activ­ity in our parks and open spaces. Chances are good by your read­ing in this space you enjoy and appre­ci­ate Ute Val­ley Park and Open space. So, I encour­age you to look for your bal­lot and hope­fully show sup­port to this effort to allow Col­or­ado Springs to secure adequate open­space and con­tinue to provide well-main­tained parks and trails throughout the city.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Another change being reques­ted by the city is to allow $20 mil­lion from a TABOR reten­tion and be des­ig­nated from this year’s funds and go towards a city­wide fire mit­ig­a­tion project. With the local eco­nomy doing well the city occa­sion­ally col­lects more rev­en­ues than it was des­ig­nated for in a year. In that instance, it can be allowed to let the city keep those funds to ded­ic­ate to spe­cific projects.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The City of Col­or­ado Springs is in a pos­i­tion this year to ask voters to des­ig­nate this year’s funds to go toward city­wide fire mit­ig­a­tion projects.

We have a few important updates and events to share with you.\n\nFirst, mark your calendars for our upcoming volunteer day on April 3rd from 5:30-7:30PM. We'll be focusing our efforts on drainage and tread work on the Winding Woods Loop trail, as well as removing invasive Mullein plants along the regional trail. Your help is crucial in maintaining the beauty and accessibility of our park. Please join us if you can! \n\nSign up [here](https://cerv.is/0132x4184) for the April 3rd event!\n\nNext, we want to take a moment to congratulate and thank our former ranger, Mark Tatro, for his years of dedicated service to Ute Valley Park. Mark has recently moved on to \"redder pastures\" and is now the senior park ranger for Garden of the Gods. While we will miss him greatly, we are thrilled for this exciting new chapter in his career. Thank you, Mark, for all you've done for our park!\n\nWith Mark's departure, the city is actively seeking to fill the park ranger position. Additionally, we need your help in identifying areas of the park that require extra attention. If you notice any troubled spots during your visits, please let us know so we can focus our volunteer efforts effectively.\n\nLastly, we're excited to announce several upcoming fundraising events in collaboration with local breweries. These \"pint nights\" are a fantastic opportunity to enjoy great beer while supporting our park. A portion of the proceeds from each event will directly benefit Friends of Ute Valley Park. Here are the details to mark your calendars (and we'll send reminders closer to the dates):\n\n* Cerberus at [Seven's Gate Tap Room](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B91xhWHEQrN3oDZp9) April 9th 4-7PM\n* [B﻿rass Brewing](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sDssNPn4tA9NnK1fA) April 17th 5-7PM\n* [W﻿ackadoo Brewing](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nH6eiqeStqgzvdbFA) May 11th 5-7PM\n* [O﻿CC Brewing](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J5QY6TCwBgumGcoM6) June 14th 6-8PM\n\nWe hope you'll join us for these fun evenings and help spread the word to your friends and family.\n\nThank you, as always, for your unwavering support and love for Ute Valley Park.

GREEN, Woodmen Edition\n\nUVP 1A group of 15 volunteers stands behind a trailer filled with shovels, polaskis and trail-building tools at Ute Valley Park. Larry Kitt, the park ranger, tells the group: \"It’s going to be an easy start for this trail-work year. I’m going to leave it to your crew leaders to give you a safety briefing, but I want to make sure that the top three things are done: safety, safety, fun!\"\n\nTrail leader Nick Cirincione, after dividing the volunteers into two groups, gives a quick safety talk. He ends by saying, \"When you’re walking with the tools, they’re not over your shoulders like ‘Hi ho, it’s off to work we go,’ but you carry them in your hand below your waist. OK?

GREEN, Woodmen Edition\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>UVP 1A group of 15 volunteers stands behind a trailer filled with shovels, polaskis and trail-building tools at Ute Valley Park. Larry Kitt, the park ranger, tells the group: “It’s going to be an easy start for this trail-work year. I’m going to leave it to your crew leaders to give you a safety briefing, but I want to make sure that the top three things are done: safety, safety, fun!”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Trail leader Nick Cirincione, after dividing the volunteers into two groups, gives a quick safety talk. He ends by saying, “When you’re walking with the tools, they’re not over your shoulders like ‘Hi ho, it’s off to work we go,’ but you carry them in your hand below your waist. OK? Now let’s get to work.”\nThe group heads up the new trail, cutting vegetation, clearing brush, creating water bars, moving boulders and tamping down loose soil.
