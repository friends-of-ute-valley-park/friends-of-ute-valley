To preserve this unique experience for everyone, it's vital to practice the Leave No Trace principle of \"Respect Wildlife.\"","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./respect-wildlife.jpg","Two mule deer bucks standing in a field of grass","## Respecting Wildlife at Ute Valley Park\n\nUte Valley Park is a beautiful natural area that many of us enjoy visiting for recreation and relaxation. However, it's important to remember that we share this space with a diverse array of wildlife. As park visitors, we have a responsibility to respect these animals and their habitat.\n\nWhen we visit the park, we are guests in the home of countless wild animals. Respecting their space and habits is not just courteous—it's crucial for their survival and the health of the ecosystem.\n\n### What does it mean to Respect Wildlife?\n\nRespecting Wildlife involves:\n\n- Observing animals from a distance to avoid distressing them.\n- Refraining from feeding wildlife, which can lead to unhealthy dependency and risk of disease.\n- Keeping pets on a leash and under control to prevent them from chasing or harassing wildlife.\n- Avoiding wildlife during sensitive times, such as mating, nesting, or when they have young with them.\n\n### Why is it important to Respect Wildlife?\n\nThis principle is important because it:\n\n- Protects animal welfare and preserves natural behaviors.\n- Maintains ecological balance and ensures species can thrive in their natural habitat. Wildlife plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy ecosystems through complex relationships like predator-prey dynamics, seed dispersal, and nutrient cycling.\n- Enhances visitor safety, as wildlife is unpredictable and can be dangerous when threatened.\n- Ensures that future visitors can also enjoy watching wildlife in its natural state.\n\n### How can visitors practice Respecting Wildlife?\n\nVisitors can show respect for wildlife by:\n\n- **Using binoculars or a zoom lens for a closer look.**\n\n  Get a close-up view without getting too close physically. This minimizes stress for animals, allows you to observe their natural behavior, and enhances your experience by revealing details you might otherwise miss.\n\n- **Being mindful of noise levels.**\n\n  Loud noises can frighten wildlife and disrupt their communication, mating rituals, and hunting behaviors, which can have far-reaching ecological consequences. Speak softly and avoid loud activities that could disturb animals in their natural habitat.\n\n- **Storing food and trash securely.**\n\n  Use bear-proof trash cans provided at park trailheads to dispose of garbage, and store your food appropriately while utilizing the park. This prevents wildlife from being attracted to human food, which can be harmful to their health and disrupt their natural foraging habits. Proper food storage also maintains the cleanliness and safety of the park for all visitors. Remember to always pack out and properly dispose of pet waste.\n\n- **Learning about the wildlife.**\n\n  Before you visit, take time to learn about the animals you might see in Ute Valley Park, such as mule deer, coyotes, rattlesnakes and black bears. Understanding their behavior and needs helps you make responsible decisions while in their presence.\n\n## Preserving the Sanctuary for All\n\nBy treating Ute Valley Park's wildlife with respect, we not only ensure the well-being of individual animals but also contribute to the long-term health of the entire ecosystem. As park visitors, we have the power to make a positive difference through our actions and choices. Let us embrace this responsibility and set a positive example for others, so that future generations may also have the opportunity to marvel at the beauty and diversity of the wildlife in this special place.\n\nBy following the Respect Wildlife principle, visitors can ensure that Ute Valley Park remains a sanctuary for both animals and people. Let's enjoy the privilege of observing these creatures by giving them the respect and space they need to live undisturbed.","src/data/leavenotrace/respect-wildlife.md",[58],"./respect-wildlife.jpg","ab6e24af84831be2",{"html":61,"metadata":62},"\u003Ch2 id=\"respecting-wildlife-at-ute-valley-park\">Respecting Wildlife at Ute Valley Park\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Ute Valley Park is a beautiful natural area that many of us enjoy visiting for recreation and relaxation.

Unfortunately, our footsteps and activities can sometimes cause harm to the land, flora, and fauna. That's where traveling on durable surfaces comes in - these surfaces can withstand or recover from the impact of our visit.\n\n## What exactly are durable surfaces?\n\nDurable surfaces are those that can handle repeated trampling and scuffing without compromising their structure or function. In Ute Valley Park, you'll find several types of durable surfaces:\n\n- Well-established trails\n- Rock, gravel and sand\n- Snow and ice\n- Water\n\n## The importance of traveling on durable surfaces\n\nBy sticking to durable surfaces, you're actively contributing to:\n\n- Preventing soil erosion and compaction\n- Safeguarding vegetation and animal habitats\n- Curbing the spread of invasive species and diseases\n- Preserving the park's natural beauty and diversity\n- Avoiding the creation of new trails that can fragment the wilderness\n- Minimizing the need for trail maintenance and restoration\n\n## Strategies for traveling on durable surfaces in Ute Valley Park\n\n### Stay on trail.\n\nVenturing off-trail is strictly prohibited in Ute Valley Park. Always stay on designated trails, which are indicated by official park signage and well-maintained paths. These trails have been carefully designed to provide a safe and enjoyable experience while protecting the natural environment. Avoid cutting switchbacks or creating shortcuts, and always follow signs to ensure you remain on approved routes.\n\n### Choose the right trail.\n\nUte Valley Park offers trails suitable for various users, including hikers, bikers, and equestrians. Choose a trail that aligns with your activity and skill level, and adhere to the signs and rules specific to each trail. By doing so, you'll help reduce conflicts and accidents among users while minimizing excessive wear and tear on the trails.\n\n### Walk through mud and snow.\n\nWhen trails are wet or snowy, walk through the center of the trail, even if it's muddy. This practice helps keep the trail narrow and prevents widening and braiding. Avoid walking around puddles or snow patches, as this can damage vegetation and lead to the creation of new trails. If the trails are excessively muddy or snowy, consider postponing your visit or opting for another trail.\n\n### Camp elsewhere.\n\nUte Valley Park does not allow camping within its boundaries. Camping is illegal and can lead to fire hazards, littering, and wildlife conflicts. If you wish to camp, please find a legal and suitable campsite outside the park.\n\n## Embrace Responsible Outdoor Ethics\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can fully immerse yourself in the beauty of Ute Valley Park while simultaneously respecting and protecting its natural environment. Remember, the essence of being outdoors lies in moving through natural areas without causing damage to the land, foliage, or waterways. Strive to leave no trace of your visit, and, if possible, leave the place even better than you found it.\n\nSo, the next time you visit Ute Valley Park, keep these tips in mind.

A lot of the change we experience is expected and accepted. Much of the change we can control, but there is a lot we cannot.","This article was originally published in the [Woodman Edition](https://gazette.com/woodmenedition/changes-afoot-at-ute-valley-park-park-place/article_e83cfd98-8cd9-11eb-bcc7-a70e5944ca66.html)\n\nAs we go through our life, we come to realize that change is and will always be a constant. A lot of the change we experience is expected and accepted. Much of the change we can control, but there is a lot we cannot.\n\nSome change we initiate, some we are good to accept, and some we really resist. Change is inevitable, time for a change, and change is good are all expressions we commonly hear on the subject. We recently changed seasons from winter to spring, although with our winter weather of late it is often difficult to discern there was a change.\n\nSome good changes have happened recently on The Friends of Ute Valley Park website ([www.friendsofutevalleypark.com](https://www.friendsofutevalleypark.com/)). We invite you to come visit the site to see our fresh new look that provides current news, park use rules, volunteering opportunities, and other key details. On the site we have also included the Leave No Trace 7 principles to encourage all of us to do our very best when enjoying other parks.\n\nWarmer, drier weather will eventually arrive, and along with it the Friends of Ute Valley Park are beginning our Volunteer Evening Work Sessions. They get underway on Wednesday, April 7. Those sessions take place, weather permitting, the first and third Wednesday of the month, from April through September. Last year we were challenged by the effects of COVID in not allowing us the number of volunteers that were willing to turn out. This year, with good guidance from the [Colorado Springs Park, Recreation and Cultural Services](https://coloradosprings.gov/parks), one change has been made. If the volunteer group grows larger, then multiple groups can be created, which will allow for work to be done on different projects in separate areas to provide the necessary social distancing.\n\nRegistration is done via the CERVIS site. To sign-up and learn all the details go to [www.friendsofutevalleypark.com](http://www.friendsofutevalleypark.com).\n\nListed below are some of the tentatively scheduled work projects for this year:\n\n- Reroute winding woods south, where we put our drains in last year.\n- Closure of rogue trails going up to Rattlesnake Ridge. This would also close off the largest undisturbed natural area in Ute Valley Park.\n- Closure of rogue trails that originate off the new Regional Trail.\n- Another project for hopeful completion this year by an Eagle Scout is to close the Creek Trail. That is the last trail that traverses through the undisturbed 40-acre natural area created two summers ago.\n\nA significant change coming this year was the recent announcement by Colorado Springs Park, Recreation and Cultural Services to allow Class 1 electric pedal-assist bicycles city-wide on all trails that allow bicycles. This is a pilot program that will begin on May 31.\n\nDue to the pandemic, our area parks typically experienced a significant activity increase with people pursuing an escape and physical activity. It is unknown how to project the amount of additional trail traffic with this change. Medicine Wheel, a local mountain bike advocacy group, was generally in favor of e-bikes access to all trails coming along in a step-by-step process — but not in a blanket effort such as this.\n\nPedal-assist e-bikes generally max out at 20 mph, and a 15 mph speed limit has been set for ALL bikes on trails. That limit will be posted, although I do not think we will see speed traps set up anywhere, so enforcement fulfillment is unclear. The community input was pretty much a 50/50 split on support or non-support.

A lot of the change we experience is expected and accepted. Much of the change we can control, but there is a lot we cannot.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some change we initiate, some we are good to accept, and some we really resist. Change is inevitable, time for a change, and change is good are all expressions we commonly hear on the subject. We recently changed seasons from winter to spring, although with our winter weather of late it is often difficult to discern there was a change.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some good changes have happened recently on The Friends of Ute Valley Park website (\u003Ca href=\"https://www.friendsofutevalleypark.com/\">www.friendsofutevalleypark.com\u003C/a>). We invite you to come visit the site to see our fresh new look that provides current news, park use rules, volunteering opportunities, and other key details. On the site we have also included the Leave No Trace 7 principles to encourage all of us to do our very best when enjoying other parks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Warmer, drier weather will eventually arrive, and along with it the Friends of Ute Valley Park are beginning our Volunteer Evening Work Sessions. They get underway on Wednesday, April 7. Those sessions take place, weather permitting, the first and third Wednesday of the month, from April through September. Last year we were challenged by the effects of COVID in not allowing us the number of volunteers that were willing to turn out. This year, with good guidance from the \u003Ca href=\"https://coloradosprings.gov/parks\">Colorado Springs Park, Recreation and Cultural Services\u003C/a>, one change has been made. If the volunteer group grows larger, then multiple groups can be created, which will allow for work to be done on different projects in separate areas to provide the necessary social distancing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Registration is done via the CERVIS site. To sign-up and learn all the details go to \u003Ca href=\"http://www.friendsofutevalleypark.com\">www.friendsofutevalleypark.com\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Listed below are some of the tentatively scheduled work projects for this year:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Reroute winding woods south, where we put our drains in last year.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Closure of rogue trails going up to Rattlesnake Ridge. This would also close off the largest undisturbed natural area in Ute Valley Park.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Closure of rogue trails that originate off the new Regional Trail.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Another project for hopeful completion this year by an Eagle Scout is to close the Creek Trail. That is the last trail that traverses through the undisturbed 40-acre natural area created two summers ago.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>A significant change coming this year was the recent announcement by Colorado Springs Park, Recreation and Cultural Services to allow Class 1 electric pedal-assist bicycles city-wide on all trails that allow bicycles. This is a pilot program that will begin on May 31.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Due to the pandemic, our area parks typically experienced a significant activity increase with people pursuing an escape and physical activity. It is unknown how to project the amount of additional trail traffic with this change. Medicine Wheel, a local mountain bike advocacy group, was generally in favor of e-bikes access to all trails coming along in a step-by-step process — but not in a blanket effort such as this.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pedal-assist e-bikes generally max out at 20 mph, and a 15 mph speed limit has been set for ALL bikes on trails. That limit will be posted, although I do not think we will see speed traps set up anywhere, so enforcement fulfillment is unclear. The community input was pretty much a 50/50 split on support or non-support. With the numbers basically being equal, going forward 100% came as a surprise, and has certainly caused some fervor.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Also, City Ordinance 97-60 states the use of no motorized vehicles to be used on park trails, but e-bikes use an electric motor making them a motorized vehicle.

The pop­u­la­tion growth in Col­or­ado Springs, and the over­whelm­ing pur­suit of out­door recre­ation dur­ing the pan­demic, has sig­ni­fic­antly increased the activ­ity in our parks and open spaces. Chances are good by your read­ing in this space you enjoy and appre­ci­ate Ute Val­ley Park and Open space. So, I encour­age you to look for your bal­lot and hope­fully show sup­port to this effort to allow Col­or­ado Springs to secure adequate open­space and con­tinue to provide well-main­tained parks and trails throughout the city.\n\nAnother change being reques­ted by the city is to allow $20 mil­lion from a TABOR reten­tion and be des­ig­nated from this year’s funds and go towards a city­wide fire mit­ig­a­tion project. With the local eco­nomy doing well the city occa­sion­ally col­lects more rev­en­ues than it was des­ig­nated for in a year. In that instance, it can be allowed to let the city keep those funds to ded­ic­ate to spe­cific projects.\n\nThe City of Col­or­ado Springs is in a pos­i­tion this year to ask voters to des­ig­nate this year’s funds to go toward city­wide fire mit­ig­a­tion projects. On the bal­lot this will be Issue 2D, and if approved by voters, it doubles the size of neigh­bor­hood chip­ping pro­grams to help keep our homes and neigh­bor­hoods safe. We have cer­tainly exper­i­enced a very smokey sum­mer here in Col­or­ado Springs due to smoke pen­et­rat­ing our atmo­sphere from fires else­where. So much so that smoke and haze have been included in reg­u­lar weather fore­casts. This effort to improve safety would allow us to catch up on 3,500 back­logged acres of mit­ig­a­tion. Plus, it would help to expand the mit­ig­a­tion pro­grams capa­city of fire risk reduc­tion from 2,000 acres up to 7,000 acres annu­ally.\n\nSev­eral changes may be com­ing but they are all good changes with the poten­tial to sig­ni­fic­antly improve the qual­ity-of-life aspect to users of Ute Val­ley Park and throughout neigh­bor­hoods and parks around the Pikes Peak Region.","src/data/news/embracing-change.md",[335],"/src/data/news/ute-news-10-6-21.jpg","084cf07b170b2a26",{"html":338,"metadata":339},"\u003Cp>This article originally appeared in the \u003Ca href=\"https://daily.gazette.com/article/281565178917014\">North Springs Edition\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The word of the day is change.

So, I encour­age you to look for your bal­lot and hope­fully show sup­port to this effort to allow Col­or­ado Springs to secure adequate open­space and con­tinue to provide well-main­tained parks and trails throughout the city.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Another change being reques­ted by the city is to allow $20 mil­lion from a TABOR reten­tion and be des­ig­nated from this year’s funds and go towards a city­wide fire mit­ig­a­tion project. With the local eco­nomy doing well the city occa­sion­ally col­lects more rev­en­ues than it was des­ig­nated for in a year. In that instance, it can be allowed to let the city keep those funds to ded­ic­ate to spe­cific projects.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The City of Col­or­ado Springs is in a pos­i­tion this year to ask voters to des­ig­nate this year’s funds to go toward city­wide fire mit­ig­a­tion projects. On the bal­lot this will be Issue 2D, and if approved by voters, it doubles the size of neigh­bor­hood chip­ping pro­grams to help keep our homes and neigh­bor­hoods safe. We have cer­tainly exper­i­enced a very smokey sum­mer here in Col­or­ado Springs due to smoke pen­et­rat­ing our atmo­sphere from fires else­where. So much so that smoke and haze have been included in reg­u­lar weather fore­casts. This effort to improve safety would allow us to catch up on 3,500 back­logged acres of mit­ig­a­tion. Plus, it would help to expand the mit­ig­a­tion pro­grams capa­city of fire risk reduc­tion from 2,000 acres up to 7,000 acres annu­ally.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sev­eral changes may be com­ing but they are all good changes with the poten­tial to sig­ni­fic­antly improve the qual­ity-of-life aspect to users of Ute Val­ley Park and throughout neigh­bor­hoods and parks around the Pikes Peak Region.\u003C/p>",{"headings":340,"localImagePaths":341,"remoteImagePaths":342,"frontmatter":343,"imagePaths":345},[],[],[],{"title":328,"published":133,"publishedOn":344,"coverImage":335,"previewText":331},["Date","2021-09-29T13:47:03.356Z"],[],"friends-of-ute-valley-park-year-end-review",{"id":346,"data":348,"body":353,"filePath":354,"assetImports":355,"digest":357,"rendered":358},{"title":349,"published":133,"publishedOn":350,"coverImage":351,"previewText":352},"Friends of Ute Valley Park Year End Review",["Date","2023-12-14T15:36:01.366Z"],"__ASTRO_IMAGE_/src/data/news/ute-news-12-14-23.jpg","As 2023 winds down it is typical to review our accomplishments during the year as well as noting those items that may still be on a To Do List.","As 2023 winds down it is typical to review our accomplishments during the year as well as noting those items that may still be on a To Do List.

We have a few important updates and events to share with you.\n\nFirst, mark your calendars for our upcoming volunteer day on April 3rd from 5:30-7:30PM. We'll be focusing our efforts on drainage and tread work on the Winding Woods Loop trail, as well as removing invasive Mullein plants along the regional trail. Your help is crucial in maintaining the beauty and accessibility of our park. Please join us if you can!\n\nSign up [here](https://cerv.is/0132x4184) for the April 3rd event!\n\nNext, we want to take a moment to congratulate and thank our former ranger, Mark Tatro, for his years of dedicated service to Ute Valley Park. Mark has recently moved on to \"redder pastures\" and is now the senior park ranger for Garden of the Gods. While we will miss him greatly, we are thrilled for this exciting new chapter in his career. Thank you, Mark, for all you've done for our park!\n\nWith Mark's departure, the city is actively seeking to fill the park ranger position. Additionally, we need your help in identifying areas of the park that require extra attention. If you notice any troubled spots during your visits, please let us know so we can focus our volunteer efforts effectively.\n\nLastly, we're excited to announce several upcoming fundraising events in collaboration with local breweries. These \"pint nights\" are a fantastic opportunity to enjoy great beer while supporting our park. A portion of the proceeds from each event will directly benefit Friends of Ute Valley Park. Here are the details to mark your calendars (and we'll send reminders closer to the dates):\n\n- Cerberus at [Seven's Gate Tap Room](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B91xhWHEQrN3oDZp9) April 9th 4-7PM\n- [B﻿rass Brewing](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sDssNPn4tA9NnK1fA) April 17th 5-7PM\n- [W﻿ackadoo Brewing](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nH6eiqeStqgzvdbFA) May 11th 5-7PM\n- [O﻿CC Brewing](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J5QY6TCwBgumGcoM6) June 14th 6-8PM\n\nWe hope you'll join us for these fun evenings and help spread the word to your friends and family.\n\nThank you, as always, for your unwavering support and love for Ute Valley Park.

Now let’s get to work.\"\nThe group heads up the new trail, cutting vegetation, clearing brush, creating water bars, moving boulders and tamping down loose soil.

The park, popular with hikers, mountain bikers and climbers, protects a foothills ecosystem of ponderosa pine and scrub oak woodlands, broad meadows and broken rock outcrops. The park’s most dramatic feature is Pope’s Bluffs, a long ridge formed of Dakota sandstone.\n\n\"It looks like we have a big group today,\" said Woods earlier, looking across the parking lot on Vindicator Drive. \"We usually have 10 to 15 volunteers, people of all ages, who show up to work on trail days.\" The Friends group organizes trail days from April through October on the first and third Wednesdays of each month. \"It’s not a huge investment of time for people,\" said Woods, \"since we work from 5:30 to about 7:30 in the evening.\"\n\nFriends of Ute Valley Park was founded in late 2012 to help facilitate the city of Colorado Springs’ purchase of 203 acres of property owned by Hewlett Packard east of the park.

Woods said, \"Our homeowner’s association over in Pinecliff where I live heard about the possible sale. Our president went to the parks department and asked, ‘How can we help with the purchase of the property?’\"\n\nThe Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Services Department told the association \"that it would be really nice if there was a Friends group who would take on the task of maintaining trails and making new trails in the existing park so that we could show that there was already some community ownership in the park.\"\n\n\"Quite frankly,\" said Woods, \"if we hadn’t been in existence, it would have been a lot tougher to get the deal made. The $110,000 we raised was a piddly amount compared to the 7.5 million that was paid for the property, but it showed we had some skin in the game. People were pretty passionate about getting it into the park rather than have it developed.\" The final transfer of the HP property to Ute Valley Park was in 2015, with the new acres managed as open space by the Palmer Land Trust. A master plan was also approved, outlining new trails in the open space and the rest of the park, creating trailheads at Tech Center Drive and off the HP road, and closing social trails. Friends of Ute Valley Park played a key role in implementing these management goals.\n\nThis year, the Friends group and its volunteers will complete the West Ridge Trail and then finish work on the East Loop Trail, which crosses the new acreage, ending at the Tech Center Drive trailhead. This work began in September with the aid of a $20,000 grant from REI, which allowed the city to hire contract trail builders to use heavy equipment on difficult terrain.\n\nThe group also plans to rehabilitate trails damaged by flooding. The Friends hosted only eight trail days last year, due to rainy weather, while the City allocated FEMA dollars to hire private contractors to repair damaged trails.\n\nLast year, Woods said Friends of Ute Valley Park had 60 volunteers put in 185 hours on the bimonthly trail days and another 170 volunteers, including 75 Air Force cadets, on National Trails Day and National Public Lands Day.\n\nAfter working for two hours, the sun drops behind the Rampart Range.

Woods, a dedicated community leader and outdoor enthusiast, played a pivotal role in the expansion and preservation of Ute Valley Park. His leadership in rallying community support to protect the park ensured that future generations could continue to enjoy its natural beauty. Dan’s journey from newcomer to founding father of Friends of Ute Valley Park (FUVP) highlights how one person's vision and determination can have a lasting impact on a community.","Dan Woods",[2328,2330],{"image":2329},"__ASTRO_IMAGE_./dan-woods-01.jpg",{"image":2331},"__ASTRO_IMAGE_./dan-woods-02.jpg","## A Lifelong Career of Leadership\n\nBefore dedicating his time to Ute Valley Park, Dan enjoyed a successful 37-year career with Procter and Gamble. After earning his Bachelor's Degree in Metallurgical Engineering from the University of Cincinnati, Dan embarked on a journey that took him, his wife Nancy, and their 3 boys, to Ohio, Louisiana, Florida, Texas, and finally China. It was while working in China that Dan decided to retire, ready for a new adventure. His career provided a foundation of leadership and problem-solving skills that would prove invaluable in his efforts to protect and expand Ute Valley Park\n\n## Answering Colorado's Call\n\nDan's story with Ute Valley Park began years before his retirement, when he and his wife Nancy took a vacation to Colorado. They instantly fell in love with the state and knew they wanted to retire there. After a search that led them down I-25 from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs, they found the perfect place to settle, with Ute Valley Park right in their backyard.\n\n## A Calling to Make a Difference\n\nDan quickly became an active member of his community, involving himself in his local and regional church. His reputation as a respected leader led Bruce Hutchison to approach him with a challenging proposition: spearhead the effort to protect and expand Ute Valley Park by 209 acres. Though he had no prior experience with such an undertaking, Dan rose to the challenge, assembling a team of concerned citizens to support the campaign. \"I had never done anything like this before,\" Dan remarked, reflecting on the team’s accomplishments, \"we have accomplished great things together.”\n\n## A Leader in Our Community\n\nDan’s dedication to Ute Valley Park has left an undeniable mark on the community. Though he may not be seen hiking the trails as often these days, his presence is felt throughout the park. The Winding Woods Trail stands as a testament to his legacy, a reminder of his tireless efforts to protect this natural treasure.\n\n## The Man Who Made a Difference\n\nThe next time you find yourself in Ute Valley Park, take a moment to appreciate the beauty that surrounds you and cherish Dan Woods – the man who helped make it all possible. His story is a testament to the power of community, leadership, and the unwavering commitment to preserving our natural heritage.","src/data/volunteer-spotlight/dan-woods.md",[2335,2336],"./dan-woods-01.jpg","./dan-woods-02.jpg","71288f3e357ca296",{"html":2339,"metadata":2340},"\u003Ch2 id=\"a-lifelong-career-of-leadership\">A Lifelong Career of Leadership\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Before dedicating his time to Ute Valley Park, Dan enjoyed a successful 37-year career with Procter and Gamble.

While Jake's love for photography has led him to capture over 150,000 images in the past decade, it's his recent dedication to trail maintenance and park preservation that's making a lasting impact on the local community. Jake's journey from newcomer to active FUVP volunteer showcases how parks can bring people together and inspire them to give back to their community.","thejakenixon","https://jakenixon.photography","Jake Nixon",[2372,2374],{"image":2373},"__ASTRO_IMAGE_./jake-nixon-01.jpg",{"image":2375},"__ASTRO_IMAGE_./jake-nixon-02.jpg","## A New Adventure in Colorado Springs\n\nJake's journey with Friends of Ute Valley Park (FUVP) began in October 2023, shortly after moving to Colorado Springs. While mountain biking through the park, he encountered a work crew and was immediately intrigued about getting involved in his new community. Despite missing the last event of the year, Jake's enthusiasm didn't wane. He followed FUVP's [social media](https://instagram.com/FriendsOfUteValleyPark) accounts and eagerly joined when activities resumed in April.\n\n## Discovering the Park's Diversity\n\nInitially drawn to trail work as a mountain biker, Jake's perspective broadened through volunteering. \"When I started volunteering at the park, I thought that trail work would cater specifically to mountain bikers,\" he shares. \"I was surprised to learn that most of the volunteers aren't gravity sports junkies—they're just normal folks that enjoy using the park.\" This experience has given Jake a deeper appreciation for the park's importance to various user groups in Colorado Springs.\n\n## Favorite Spots and Activities\n\nAs an avid mountain biker, Jake's favorite activity in Ute Valley Park comes as no surprise. \"I bike to work on the Winding Woods trail as many days as I can,\" he says. Always up for a new challenge, Jake adds, \"I'd like to try cross country skiing to work sometime this winter.\"\n\n## The Joy of Volunteering\n\nJake's enthusiasm for volunteering with FUVP is contagious. \"Volunteering with FUVP is an absolute blast,\" he exclaims. \"Trail work nights are only two hours long and frequently end with gorgeous sunsets spent with new friends.\" He believes that the experience can lift anyone's spirits, saying, \"Even if I have a hard day, showing up in the park with gloves and safety glasses puts a smile on my face, and I bet it would do the same to just about anyone.\"\n\n## Advice for Aspiring Volunteers\n\nFor those considering getting involved, Jake offers some practical advice: \"I recommend putting the energy into learning people's names as early as possible! It's a simple way to show other volunteers that you're there because you want to put the time into making something beautiful.\" He emphasizes the multiple benefits of volunteering, stating, \"Spending time every other Wednesday evening in the park will make you stronger, happier, it will show you more sunsets, and it will connect you to neighbors that you probably wouldn't meet otherwise!\"\n\n## A Fun Fact\n\nIn a lighthearted moment, Jake shares a unique personal tidbit: \"I learned how to burp for the first time in 2022! I'm not sure how I survived so long without being able to burp!\" This fun fact showcases Jake's approachable personality and ability to find joy in life's little surprises.\nJake's story is a testament to the power of community involvement and the unexpected joys that can come from volunteering. His experience with Friends of Ute Valley Park not only deepened his connection to his new home but also broadened his understanding of community and conservation.
