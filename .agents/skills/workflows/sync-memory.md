# Sync Memory Workflow

This workflow captures lessons learned from the current session and updates the project memory file (GEMINI.md).

## Steps

1. **Review the session for friction points**
   - Identify moments where backtracking occurred
   - Note any misunderstandings about scope or requirements
   - Find instances where a different approach would have been faster

2. **Identify efficiency gains**
   - What patterns worked well?
   - What shortcuts or utilities could have been used earlier?
   - What clarifying questions should have been asked upfront?

3. **Read current GEMINI.md**
   - Check existing lessons to avoid duplicates
   - Understand current structure and conventions

4. **Update GEMINI.md with new learnings**
   - Add date-stamped entry under "Lessons Learned" section
   - Include:
     - **Context**: Brief description of the task
     - **Friction Points Encountered**: What went wrong or caused rework
     - **Actionable Lessons**: Specific, reusable guidance for future tasks
   - Update "Quick Reference" if new patterns/utilities were discovered
   - Update "Key Patterns & Conventions" if new conventions were established

5. **Format for clarity**
   - Use headers and bullet points
   - Keep lessons concise and actionable
   - Include code snippets for patterns where helpful

## Template for New Lesson Entry

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD: [Brief Task Description]
**Context**: [What were you trying to accomplish]

**Friction Points Encountered**:
1. [What went wrong]
2. [What caused rework]

**Actionable Lessons**:
1. [Specific guidance to prevent this in future]
2. [Pattern or approach to follow]
```

## When to Run This Workflow

- At the end of any session with significant learnings
- After resolving a tricky bug or implementation challenge
- When discovering new project patterns or conventions
- When user explicitly requests memory sync
