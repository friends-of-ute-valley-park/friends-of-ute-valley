Dear Friends of Ute Valley Park,

We hope this message finds you well and excited for the upcoming spring season in our beloved park! We have a few important updates and events to share with you.

First, mark your calendars for our upcoming volunteer day on April 3rd from 5:30-7:30PM. We'll be focusing our efforts on drainage and tread work on the Winding Woods Loop trail, as well as removing invasive Mullein plants along the regional trail. Your help is crucial in maintaining the beauty and accessibility of our park. Please join us if you can!

Sign up [here](https://cerv.is/0132x4184) for the April 3rd event!

Next, we want to take a moment to congratulate and thank our former ranger, Mark Tatro, for his years of dedicated service to Ute Valley Park. Mark has recently moved on to "redder pastures" and is now the senior park ranger for Garden of the Gods. While we will miss him greatly, we are thrilled for this exciting new chapter in his career. Thank you, Mark, for all you've done for our park!

With Mark's departure, the city is actively seeking to fill the park ranger position. Additionally, we need your help in identifying areas of the park that require extra attention. If you notice any troubled spots during your visits, please let us know so we can focus our volunteer efforts effectively.

Lastly, we're excited to announce several upcoming fundraising events in collaboration with local breweries. These "pint nights" are a fantastic opportunity to enjoy great beer while supporting our park. A portion of the proceeds from each event will directly benefit Friends of Ute Valley Park. Here are the details to mark your calendars (and we'll send reminders closer to the dates):

- Cerberus at [Seven's Gate Tap Room](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B91xhWHEQrN3oDZp9) April 9th 4-7PM

- [O﻿CC Brewing](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J5QY6TCwBgumGcoM6) June 14th 6-8PM

We hope you'll join us for these fun evenings and help spread the word to your friends and family.

Thank you, as always, for your unwavering support and love for Ute Valley Park. Together, we can continue to make it a beautiful, welcoming space for everyone to enjoy.

Best regards, The Friends of Ute Valley Park Team
