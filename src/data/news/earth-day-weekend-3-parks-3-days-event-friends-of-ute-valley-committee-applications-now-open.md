Dear Friends of Ute Valley,

We are excited to announce that Friends of Ute Valley will be participating in the Earth Day Weekend "3 Parks 3 Days" service event, sponsored by Colorado Springs Parks and Recreation.

The "3 Parks 3 Days" event is a wonderful way to get involved with different parks and groups from around the city. Not only will you have the chance to make a positive impact on these natural spaces, but you'll also have the opportunity to meet new people who share your passion for the outdoors.

We encourage you to join us for one or more of these events and help make a positive impact on our local parks and open spaces. By volunteering your time and effort, you'll be directly contributing to the preservation and enhancement of these natural treasures.
