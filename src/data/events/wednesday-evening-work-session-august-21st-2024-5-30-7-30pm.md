Come join the Friends of Ute Valley and COSMBA on our Wednesday night volunteer work session! We will be focusing on putting the finishing touches on the Regional Trail. This will include refining backslope, raking out material, knocking down berms, establishing drainage, and restoration. Please wear pants and closed-toe shoes, bring work gloves, eye protection, sunscreen, water, and snacks.
