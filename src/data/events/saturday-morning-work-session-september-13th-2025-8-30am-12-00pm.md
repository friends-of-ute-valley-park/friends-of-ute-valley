Come join the Friends of Ute Valley for a Saturday morning volunteer event involving some corridor clearing, drain maintenance, and invasive plant removal along Black and Blue Loop. Please wear pants and closed-toe shoes, bring work gloves, eye protection, sunscreen, water, and snacks. Meeting location is at the Ute Valley Trail Parking Lot off of Rockrimmon. Out of respect for the effort and dedication of our Friends Groups and regular volunteers, we do ask that anyone who signs up to participate is committed to the full length of the event and that all cancelations are made as soon as possible.
