date: 2025-08-06T17:30:00.000Z
description: Come join the Friends of Ute Valley for a Wednesday night volunteer event as we do some refining work on a short trail reroute. This work will include shaping the tread to ensure a proper outslope and drainage, cleaning up the backslope, and other minor enhancements to the new trail. Unsure of what these terms mean? That's okay, we'll show you everything you need to know! Please wear pants and closed-toe shoes, bring work gloves, eye protection, sunscreen, water, and snacks. Out of respect for the effort and dedication of our Friends Groups and regular volunteers, we do ask that anyone who signs up to participate is committed to the full length of the event and that all cancelations are made as soon as possible.
