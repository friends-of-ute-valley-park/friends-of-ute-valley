You can be part of the largest watershed-wide clean-up in the state of Colorado by volunteering with Friends of Ute Valley Park this Saturday (9/28) as we lead efforts to clean up around the Pine Cliff/Ute Valley roads and trails that drain into the Fountain Creek watershed. Meet us at the Tech Center trailhead at 9 AM; we expect to wrap up around noon. Get outdoors, get active, and create some good for your community and those living and playing downstream!

Use the contact form on our website for additional information. **Registration not required.**
