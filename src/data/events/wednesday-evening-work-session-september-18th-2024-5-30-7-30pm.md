Come join the Friends of Ute Valley on our Wednesday night volunteer work session! We will be focusing on some tread work along a short section of Rocky Top Loop. Work will include re-establishing outslope, refining backslope, and improving drainage. Please wear pants and closed-toe shoes, bring work gloves, eye protection, sunscreen, water, and snacks.
