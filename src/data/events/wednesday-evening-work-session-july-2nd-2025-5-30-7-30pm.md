Come join the Friends of Ute Valley for a Wednesday night volunteer event as we do some noxious weed mitigation and corridor clearing around Winding Woods and Bea-UTE-iful loop. Please wear pants and closed-toe shoes, bring work gloves, eye protection, sunscreen, water, and snacks. **Out of respect for the effort and dedication of our Friends Groups and regular volunteers, we do ask that anyone who signs up to participate is committed to the full length of the event and that all cancelations are made as soon as possible.**
