Come join the Friends of Ute Valley on a special Saturday session as we close and restore social trails! Please wear pants and closed-toe shoes, bring work gloves, eye protection, sunscreen, water, and snacks. Out of respect for the effort and dedication of our Friends Groups and regular volunteers, we do ask that anyone who signs up to participate is committed to the full length of the event and that all cancelations are made as soon as possible.
