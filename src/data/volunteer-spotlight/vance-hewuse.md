## A Runner's Journey to Volunteering

Vance's connection to Ute Valley Park began long before he started volunteering. "I started running Ute Valley Park ridges in 1987 and continuously do so," he shares. His transition from park user to dedicated volunteer happened by chance one evening when he was running late and encountered Christine Thomas and a small crew. They expressed a need for additional volunteers and invited him to the next work night.

That encounter proved to be a turning point for Vance. "The following work nights demonstrated the crew's love for this park was a team I wanted to work with in restoring and preserving this park's importance to the community," he recalls. Vance's commitment deepened quickly. "The following spring I was certified by the Rocky Mountain Field Institute (RMFI) as a Crew Leader and have rarely missed a work night since."

## A Spiritual Connection to Nature

For Vance, running in Ute Valley Park is more than just exercise—it's a spiritual experience. "When I'm running I'm praying," he reveals, "and not just to assure this old fella doesn't fall but mostly an extreme thankfulness for this array of hues, sounds and feelings this unbelievable creation has on my senses." This deep appreciation for nature fuels his dedication to preserving and improving the park.

## Favorite Spots and Activities

As an avid runner, Vance has a special affinity for the West Ridge of Ute Valley Park. "I have run the West Ridge of Ute Valley Park 3-5 times a week since 1987," he says. "It absolutely has the best 360 degree views of all the parks in El Paso County and a surreal feeling this was a strategic trail of the Núu-agha-tʉvʉ-pʉ̱ (Ute)." His connection to this trail spans decades, making his volunteer work all the more meaningful.

## Understanding the Park's Importance

Vance's involvement in various activities at the park has given him a broad perspective on its importance to different user groups. "I race in several of the races in the park and am grateful for all the work that we volunteers do to assure trails remain sustainable to protect the wildlife and vegetation," he explains. "Trail maintenance assures the greatest number of individuals can enjoy the park whether they are walkers, bikers or runners. Oh throw in the occasional horse riders."

## Inspiring Others to Volunteer

When asked how to inspire more people to volunteer, Vance had a creative suggestion: "UVP needs a mascot. Then use the mascot in a poster with its finger pointing out saying 'UVP needs you'. Yes, it's similar to the WWII Uncle Sam Poster."

## Advice for Potential Volunteers

For those considering volunteering, Vance emphasizes the sense of accomplishment it brings: "If you want a real sense of achievement and contribution to the community, you will get it when you look back over your work in restoring a trail to a sustainable path that many will use in their enjoyment of nature up close." His words highlight the tangible impact volunteers can have on their community and environment.
