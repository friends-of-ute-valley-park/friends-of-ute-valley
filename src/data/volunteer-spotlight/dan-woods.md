## A Lifelong Career of Leadership

Before dedicating his time to Ute Valley Park, Dan enjoyed a successful 37-year career with Procter and Gamble. After earning his Bachelor's Degree in Metallurgical Engineering from the University of Cincinnati, Dan embarked on a journey that took him, his wife Nancy, and their 3 boys, to Ohio, Louisiana, Florida, Texas, and finally China. It was while working in China that Dan decided to retire, ready for a new adventure. His career provided a foundation of leadership and problem-solving skills that would prove invaluable in his efforts to protect and expand Ute Valley Park

## Answering Colorado's Call

Dan's story with Ute Valley Park began years before his retirement, when he and his wife Nancy took a vacation to Colorado. They instantly fell in love with the state and knew they wanted to retire there. After a search that led them down I-25 from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs, they found the perfect place to settle, with Ute Valley Park right in their backyard.

## A Calling to Make a Difference

Dan quickly became an active member of his community, involving himself in his local and regional church. His reputation as a respected leader led Bruce Hutchison to approach him with a challenging proposition: spearhead the effort to protect and expand Ute Valley Park by 209 acres. Though he had no prior experience with such an undertaking, Dan rose to the challenge, assembling a team of concerned citizens to support the campaign. "I had never done anything like this before," Dan remarked, reflecting on the team’s accomplishments, "we have accomplished great things together.”
