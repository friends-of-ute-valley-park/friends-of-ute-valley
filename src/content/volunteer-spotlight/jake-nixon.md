## A New Adventure in Colorado Springs
Jake's journey with Friends of Ute Valley Park (FUVP) began in October 2023, shortly after moving to Colorado Springs. While mountain biking through the park, he encountered a work crew and was immediately intrigued about getting involved in his new community. Despite missing the last event of the year, Jake's enthusiasm didn't wane. He followed FUVP's [social media](https://instagram.com/FriendsOfUteValleyPark) accounts and eagerly joined when activities resumed in April.

## Discovering the Park's Diversity

Initially drawn to trail work as a mountain biker, Jake's perspective broadened through volunteering. "When I started volunteering at the park, I thought that trail work would cater specifically to mountain bikers," he shares. "I was surprised to learn that most of the volunteers aren't gravity sports junkiesâ€”they're just normal folks that enjoy using the park." This experience has given Jake a deeper appreciation for the park's importance to various user groups in Colorado Springs.
## Favorite Spots and Activities

As an avid mountain biker, Jake's favorite activity in Ute Valley Park comes as no surprise. "I bike to work on the Winding Woods trail as many days as I can," he says. Always up for a new challenge, Jake adds, "I'd like to try cross country skiing to work sometime this winter."

## The Joy of Volunteering

Jake's enthusiasm for volunteering with FUVP is contagious. "Volunteering with FUVP is an absolute blast," he exclaims. "Trail work nights are only two hours long and frequently end with gorgeous sunsets spent with new friends." He believes that the experience can lift anyone's spirits, saying, "Even if I have a hard day, showing up in the park with gloves and safety glasses puts a smile on my face, and I bet it would do the same to just about anyone."

## Advice for Aspiring Volunteers

For those considering getting involved, Jake offers some practical advice: "I recommend putting the energy into learning people's names as early as possible! It's a simple way to show other volunteers that you're there because you want to put the time into making something beautiful." He emphasizes the multiple benefits of volunteering, stating, "Spending time every other Wednesday evening in the park will make you stronger, happier, it will show you more sunsets, and it will connect you to neighbors that you probably wouldn't meet otherwise!"

## A Fun Fact

In a lighthearted moment, Jake shares a unique personal tidbit: "I learned how to burp for the first time in 2022! I'm not sure how I survived so long without being able to burp!" This fun fact showcases Jake's approachable personality and ability to find joy in life's little surprises.
Jake's story is a testament to the power of community involvement and the unexpected joys that can come from volunteering. His experience with Friends of Ute Valley Park not only deepened his connection to his new home but also broadened his understanding of community and conservation. Through his lens as both a photographer and a volunteer, Jake continues to capture and contribute to the beauty of Ute Valley Park.
