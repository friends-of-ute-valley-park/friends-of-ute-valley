Construction begins on the Ute Valley Regional Trail on **FRIDAY, JULY 9TH**. This project is part of the Master Plan for the trail, and will include removal of existing asphalt maintenance road, construction of a widened gravel trail, installation of a pedestrian bridge, and additional improvements for connection of new trail to the trailhead. Trail closure is expected through mid-September, weather depending.

The Sunnyside Trail crossing of the area of construction is planned to stay open at this time. Please follow the directions of signage in this area and cross with caution.
