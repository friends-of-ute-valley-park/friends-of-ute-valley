Come join the Friends of Ute Valley on our Wednesday night volunteer work session as we continue work on the Winding Woods reroute near the Popes Valley entrance. Please wear pants and closed-toe shoes, bring work gloves, sunscreen, water, snacks and bring **SOMETHING TO ACT AS A MASK** that covers your mouth and nose (bandanna, buff, etc.). Meet up location is at the Popes Valley entrance into Ute Valley. From there we will be dividing up into teams to accomplish our goals.
