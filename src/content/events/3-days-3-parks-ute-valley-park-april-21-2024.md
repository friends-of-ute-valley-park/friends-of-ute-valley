The 3 days / 3 parks event is a multiday, multi-park collaboration between the Friends of Peregrine Parks and Open Spaces, the Guardians of Palmer Park, and the Friends of Ute Valley. The idea is to help create a community between the groups and get some awesome work accomplished at Blodgett Open Space, Palmer Park, and Ute Valley Park!
