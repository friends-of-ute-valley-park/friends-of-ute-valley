The 3 Parks in 3 Days - Earth Day Weekend event is back! This is a multiday, multi-park collaboration between the Friends of Peregrine Parks and Open Spaces, the Guardians of Palmer Park, and the Friends of Ute Valley. The idea is to help create a community between the groups and get some awesome work accomplished at Blodgett Open Space, Palmer Park, and Ute Valley Park! Sign up for one day or sign up for all the days!

Saturday, April 29th is the Ute Valley Park volunteer day in which we will be restoring the old utilities access road in the middle of the valley, building buck n rail fencing, and performing finishing touches on the completed sections of the Ute Valley Regional Trail.

After the work day, the Guardians and Friends have set up a social event at Goat Patch Brewing off of Cascade for all to join!

Please wear pants and closed-toe shoes, bring work gloves, sunscreen, water, and snacks.

You _must_ register to participate in this event.
