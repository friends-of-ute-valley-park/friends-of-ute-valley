The 3 days / 3 parks event is a multiday, multi-park collaboration between the Friends of Peregrine Parks and Open Spaces, the Guardians of Palmer Park, and the Friends of Ute Valley. The idea is to help create a community between the groups and get some awesome work accomplished at Blodgett Open Space, Palmer Park, and Ute Valley Park!

 Sunday, April 27th is the Ute Valley Park volunteer day. We will be decompacting and reseeding social trails around the Vindicator meadow and removing trash and invasives throughout the park. 

 Please wear pants and closed-toe shoes, bring work gloves, sunscreen, water, and snacks.

\*\*Meet up location is at Eagleview Middle School.\*\*
