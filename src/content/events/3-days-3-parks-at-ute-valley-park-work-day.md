The 3 days / 3 parks event is a multiday, multi-park collaboration between the Friends of Peregrine Parks and Open Spaces, the Guardians of Palmer Park, and the Friends of Ute Valley. The idea is to help create a community between the groups and get some awesome work accomplished at Blodgett Open Space, Palmer Park, and Ute Valley Park!

Sunday, April 24th is the Ute Valley Park volunteer day and we will be restoring up to 3,000 feet of decommissioned trail that crisscrosses the meadow at the Vindicator Trailhead.

After the work day, there will be a social event at Lost Friends Brewing off of Academy and Montebello for all to join!

Please wear pants and closed-toe shoes, bring work gloves, sunscreen, water, and snacks.

\*\*Meet up location is at the Vindicator Trailhead.\*\*
