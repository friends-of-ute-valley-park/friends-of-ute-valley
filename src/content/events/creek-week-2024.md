You can be part of the largest watershed-wide clean-up in the state of Colorado by volunteering with Friends of Ute Valley Park this Saturday (9/28) as we lead efforts to clean up around the Pine Cliff/Ute Valley roads and trails that drain into the Fountain Creek watershed. Meet us at the Tech Center trailhead at 9 AM; we expect to wrap up around noon. Get outdoors, get active, and create some good for your community and those living and playing downstream!
