Dear Friends,

2020 was a great year with a long list of accomplishments for Ute Valley Park. It took many organizations and individuals to make it all happen: Parks and Open Space professionals, local businesses, board members and other volunteers.

## East Loop Trail 

With the $20,000 grant from REI and $1,000 grant from SRAM, the southern part of this loop trail was completed. A beautiful and functional bridge was installed over the creek and the loop was connected to the newly constructed trailhead on the HP access road. There are a few items remaining for the HP trailhead and the Tech. Center Drive trailhead which will get finished in the Spring of 2021. Volunteers sustained and preserved existing trails: More than 50 people volunteered a total of more than 504 hours on first and third Wednesdays to help improve the park we all love.

## Statistics

Here are some other statistics for 2020 that you may be interested in:

* Approximate number of Board Meeting Hours: 240
* Approximate number of board member hours outside of meetings: 200
* Total number of work days organized: 19
* Total number of crew leader work day hours: 77

## Other Accomplishments

* Switched fiscal sponsorship from the Pikes Peak Community Foundation (PPCF) to the Trails and Open Space Coalition (TOSC). Since PPCF was eliminating their fiscal sponsorship program, the move to TOSC saved us from having to apply for our own 501 (c)3 and the costs associated with it. Money saved means more available for trail maintenance and preservation.
* Closed “Left Shark Trail,” which preserved 40+ acres for wildlife habitat.
* Closed many social (rogue) trails along the Pine Ridge Trail.
* Rehabbed some of Scrub Oak Path.
* Worked with the Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Services Department (PRCS) to develop a plan for the Golden Hills Neighborhood entrance to the Ute Valley
* Open Space. We continued our newspaper column and electronic newsletter: The Park Place column launched in 2015 appears bi-monthly in the Woodmen Edition. The focus of the column is to regularly provide information and photos about all things related to Ute Valley Park and the associated efforts of the Friends of Ute Valley Park. Also, Friends of Ute Valley Park continue to receive a monthly email newsletter that highlights upcoming volunteer opportunities and other park news and events. Readers are welcome to submit story ideas for both the newspaper column and newsletter.

## 2021 Goals

We are currently working with PRCS Dept. to develop our work plan for 2021. As of this writing, we have not settled on our plan.

## Donations 

Now that we are no longer sponsored by PPCF, donations should be sent to TOSC. You can donate through their website: www.trailsandopenspaces.org, or by sending to: Trails and Open Space Coalition, 702 East Boulder Street, Suite 200, Colorado Springs, CO 80903. Make checks out to TOSC and on the memo line, put: for Friends of Ute Valley Park. We are grateful for all the support we have received from the community and look forward to our work together in 2021.
