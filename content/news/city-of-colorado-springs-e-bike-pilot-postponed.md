The upcoming e-bike pilot program created by Colorado Spring's Parks, Recreation & Cultural Services department has been postponed until further notice.  The pilot program would allow class 1 e-bikes on all city owned trails including Ute Valley Park and other open spaces.  Until the city proceeds with the pilot program e-bikes are strictly **forbidden** in Ute Valley Park and all other city owned trails and open spaces except city owned Urban Trails which would allow class 2 e-bikes.

The delayed start to the pilot program "will allow the department to continue its due diligence in seeking further clarification on the definition of e-bikes and its alignment with the Code of the City of Colorado Springs."
