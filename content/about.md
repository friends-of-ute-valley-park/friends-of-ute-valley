Friends of Ute Valley Park is an officially recognized “Friends” organization by the City of Colorado Springs Parks and Recreation Department. Our mission is to maintain, preserve, and provide education for Ute Valley Park. Our mission is in alignment with the goals and master plan of the City of Colorado Springs Parks and Recreation Department.

In early 2014, Ute Valley Park was expanded with the acquisition of the adjacent Hewlett Packard property through TOPS. The last half of the former HP property was formerly transferred to Ute Valley Park in early 2015.

We are implementing our mission in Ute Valley Park through maintenance projects and educational events. We are fully committed to provide this same level of support for the newly expanded park.

Support for our efforts has been both passionate and overwhelming. This passion and support comes because people love the beauty and serenity that Ute Valley provides, as well as the many recreational opportunities such as walking, hiking, running and biking.

We are not just a local community organization, considering ourselves to be good stewards of the land for the entire community and the Pikes Peak region.
